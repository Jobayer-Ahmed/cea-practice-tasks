Bitcoin and all other virtual currencies give much liberty to the users because of not relying on banks and government. However, this technology brings up also cybercrime especially money laundering, shifting black money and so on. Cybercrime investigation teams are facing problems with analyzing and tracing such money. There has been some research on analyzing this money by companies , government and researchers. Up to now in most of this research machine learning has been excluded. But particular attention on analyzing the blockchain with neural networks (NN), i.e. Recurrent NN (RNN) or Convolutional NN (ConvNet) should be payed. The reason for this is that first, such as RNN provide the ability for processing sequences and Bitcoin transactions are fully linked where money is transferred. This is one of the base cases in analyzing the blockchain. There are also some other problems like identifying CoinJoin transaction via generating all partitions of a set or the performance that has to be optimized because the blockchain is big(e.g. 90 GB and increasing) and nearly every byte needs to be indexed. My goal is to identify fraudulent or malicious transactions with algorithms of machine learning especially RNN and ConvNet, Bayes Statistics and techniques of NLP.\",\"Link\":\"https://moneo.io/erhard\",\"Index\":32},{\"Name.innerText\":\"Qusai Jouda\",\"Title.innerText\":\"Blockchain \u0026gt; Blockchain Consulting\",\"Bio.innerText\":\"Freelancer who is skilled in building Software Applications, Front-end Development, and Decentralized Systems like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and all other virtual currencies give much liberty to the users because of not relying on banks and government. However, this technology brings up also cybercrime especially money laundering, shifting black money and so on. Cybercrime investigation teams are facing problems with analyzing and tracing such money. There has been some research on analyzing this money by companies , government and researchers. Up to now in most of this research machine learning has been excluded. But particular attention on analyzing the blockchain with neural networks (NN), i.e. Recurrent NN (RNN) or Convolutional NN (ConvNet) should be payed. The reason for this is that first, such as RNN provide the ability for processing sequences and Bitcoin transactions are fully linked where money is transferred. This is one of the base cases in analyzing the blockchain. There are also some other problems like identifying CoinJoin transaction via generating all partitions of a set or the performance that has to be optimized because the blockchain is big(e.g. 90 GB and increasing) and nearly every byte needs to be indexed. My goal is to identify fraudulent or malicious transactions with algorithms of machine learning especially RNN and ConvNet, Bayes Statistics and techniques of NLP.\"},\"Link\":\"https://moneo.io/erhard\",\"Index\":32}],[{\"Name\":{\"innerText\":\"Qusai Jouda\"},\"Title\":{\"innerText\":\"Blockchain \u0026gt; Blockchain Consulting\"},\"Bio\":{\"innerText\":\"Freelancer who is skilled in building Software Applications, Front-end Development, and Decentralized Systems like Bitcoin.
